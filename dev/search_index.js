Given a board position as an input, it estimates the probability for each player to ultimately win the game. It also provides a quantitative estimate of the relative quality of all available moves in the form of a probability distribution.\nThe search component is powered by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which implements a good compromise between breadth-first and depth-first search and provides a principled way to manage the uncertainty introduced by the heuristics. Also, given a position, it does not return a single choice for a best move but rather a probability distribution over available moves.\nAt each training iteration, AlphaZero plays a series of games against itself. The network is then updated so that it makes more accurate predictions about the outcome of these games. Also, the network's policy heuristic is updated to match the output of MCTS on all encountered positions. This way, MCTS can be seen as a powerful policy improvement operator.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/alphazero_intro/","page":"Introduction to AlphaZero","title":"Introduction to AlphaZero","text":"For more details, we recommend the following resources.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/alphazero_intro/#External-resources","page":"Introduction to AlphaZero","title":"External resources","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/alphazero_intro/","page":"Introduction to AlphaZero","title":"Introduction to AlphaZero","text":"A short and effective introduction to AlphaZero is Surag Nair's  excellent tutorial.\nA good resource to learn about Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is this  Int8 tutorial.\nThen, DeepMind's original  Nature paper  is a nice read.\nFinally, this series of posts  from Oracle has been an important source of inspiration for AlphaZero.jl.
